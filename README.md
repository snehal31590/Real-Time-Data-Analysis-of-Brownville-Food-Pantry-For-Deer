# Real-Time-Data-Analysis-of-Brownville-Food-Pantry-For-Deer

1. This dataset was picked from Youtube < https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viEDIdNulgI > for real-time data analysis. 

2. Exploratory data analysis was done using Pandas
3.The dataset contains dirty data, so the first step we had to do before plotting the data was to clean it. Mixed into good data, we faced: 
          Missing values
          Null values
          Corrupt values
After cleaning the data, the data set was left with 381 rows.

4. The columns used to create the scatter plots were: 
     total pounds of apples
     total pounds of oats
     total pounds of acorns
     ambient temperature at feeding
     total deer waiting to eat
The plots are as shown in the python Notebook.


5. The dataset appears to be a time series dataset that tracks the amount of food consumed by deer at a food pantry over a certain period of time.

   It includes several variables such as the total pounds of food consumed, the type of food (such as oats or acorns), the ambient temperature at feeding time, and the total number of deer waiting to eat.
